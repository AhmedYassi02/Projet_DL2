DeepLearning 2 project
=======================


This project is a simple implementation of RBM (Restricted Boltzmann Machine) and DBN (Deep Belief Network) using Python and using them on Binary AlphaDigits dataset. It is also an implementation of a DNN (DBN + classification layer) to classify the MNIST dataset.
